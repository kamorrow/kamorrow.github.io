More than 11 million hectares burned, principally in the southeast provinces of New South Wales and Victoria. Only thirty-three people lost their lives, but more than a billion animals are estimated to have been killed, including on Kangaroo Island, a haven for biological diversity.\r\nThe current government of Australia shies away from connecting the intensity of the bushfires to climate change or acknowledging the intense impacts of climate change on the country. CLimate scientists, on the othe rhand, agree that the extremely high temperatures and severe drought that fueled the bushfires are undoubtedly linked to climate change. (BBC)\r\nIn light of the devastation of these fires, the R For Data Science #tidytuesday prompt for 01-07-2020 included data on the fires and the climate of Australia.
