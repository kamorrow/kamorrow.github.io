Students in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management 
[Strategic Environmental Communication](https://www.brencomm.com/) complete a capstone project for a client as part of their interdisciplinary communication education.

In collaboration with two other students and the National Parks Service, I developed and presented an ESRI StoryMap entitled Water Balance in National Parks to culminate this experience.
