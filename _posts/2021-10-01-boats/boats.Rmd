It's sometimes also an incredibly difficult experience to describe.

### The Basics

Between April 2014 and November 2015 then again in 2018 I worked on five different tall ships on the East Coast and in the Pacific Northwest. A tall ship is an amorphous designation for traditionally-rigged sailing vessels, ranging from sloops and schooners to brigs and barquetines.

The five boats that I worked on are:

- *Clearwater* operated by [Hudson River Sloop Clearwater](https://www.clearwater.org/)

- *Adventuress* operated by [Sound Experience](https://www.soundexp.org/)

- *Brilliant* operated by [Mystic Seaport](https://www.mysticseaport.org/)

- *AJ Meerwald* operated by [Bayshore Center at Bivalve](https://www.bayshorecenter.org/)

- *Mystic Whaler* operated by [Mystic Whaler Cruises](https://www.theday.com/article/20211018/NWS01/211019439) for Hudson River Sloop Clearwater

Each one offered different a perspective on the modern maritime industry through the lens of education.  While *Brilliant* focused on teen sail training for the summer I was onboard, the other organizations are dedicated to place-based environmental education.

### The Takeaways

The education-driven missions of these boats combine with the requirements for successfully operating them to create a strong sense of community and incredible feats of teamwork.  Within the first two weeks of setting foot on my first boat, I found myself working with a dozen other people to safely maneuver a massive fuel tank below decks and through a door into the tight quarters of the bosun's locker.  It was an endeavor that required strength and coordination as well as incredible synergy between the crew and our leadership and just one of many delicate tasks I helped achieve that season and in my other positions on other boats. At the end, exhausted and exhilarated, I scrambled out of the depths of the locker, over the newly placed fuel tank, and up to the deck to replace the hatch and have a well deserved drink of water with my shipmates.

It was on boats that I gained expertise in communicating complex concepts to individuals and groups with diverse backgrounds and knowledge levels.  From explaining plankton to 5 year-olds  to discussing the nuances of energy policy's impacts on riparian and marine ecosystems to talking about marine mammals in French, the tasks I took on as an educator tested then expanded my abilities.  This experience particularly contributed to my success working on the [Connecticut Public Use and Benefit Land Registry](https://kamorrow.github.io/posts/2021-09-05-publr/), allowing me to connect with different stakeholders and successfully develop the internship program that catapulted the project to success.

This work also contributed to my systems-based approach to problem solving. When operating a vessel there is a constant ebb and flow of tasks that need to happen to accomplish the goals set forward by the captain.  If one part out of a dozen does not execute correctly,  the entire process is at risk of failure. As a crewmember, I developed the ability to swiftly assess the task that was presented, observe what aspects were complete or underway, and dynamically step into roles that needed to be done before moving on to the next task.  I find that this approach to problem solving came through particularly strongly while working on my [thesis-equivalent master's group project](https://kamorrow.github.io/posts/2021-09-05-gp/), where my role as data manager led me to support my team in myriad ways, each requiring different skills, insights, and tasks in a dynamic landscape of urgency and complexity.

**1900** Stood down! (Work is done for the day and only the designated person on watch has duties until the next morning.)

### FAQ's

**Are you pirates?** No.

**Do you live onboard?** Yes.  While we're working onboard, we live on the boat and travel with with it to different ports.  Below decks are cabins and bunks for us to sleep in, a galley to make food in, and space for us to spend time together at meals and in off hours.

**How often do you climb aloft?** On the boats I worked on it wasn't necessary to leave the deck to change the sails. Typically 

**What are those fuzzy thing?**

Baggywrinkles.  These are made from old rope tied to make a pompom-like mop.  We put them on the parts of the rigging that could wear holes in the sails to prevent that.  Baggywrinkles are a kind of chafe gear, or materials that are used to pad or protect ropes, sails, and other areas to keep them in good condition for as long as possible. Another common form of chafe gear is lengths of old fire hose tied around docklines at places where they may rub on the dock, pilings, or boat as the waves and tides move the boat.
